Pods: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They can contain one or more containers that share network and storage resources. Pods are scheduled onto nodes, and they can be replicated for scalability. Services: Services define a network endpoint for a set of pods. They enable load balancing and provide a stable DNS name for accessing pods. There are different types of services, including ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, for various use cases. Controllers: Controllers manage the desired state of pods and ensure that the actual state matches the desired state. Common controllers include ReplicaSets, Deployments, and StatefulSets. Getting started with Kubernetes Install Deployment Steps using IAC (Infrastructure as Code): To deploy applications on Kubernetes using IAC principles, you can follow these steps: Set up a Kubernetes Cluster: Use a tool like kubeadm, managed Kubernetes services (e.g., EKS, AKS, GKE), or a Kubernetes distribution to create a cluster. Define the cluster infrastructure in IAC (e.g., Terraform or AWS CloudFormation templates) if needed. Define Kubernetes Manifests: Write Kubernetes YAML manifests (IAC) for your application components, including Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets. Manifests describe the desired state of your application and how it should be deployed. Version Control: Store your Kubernetes manifests in version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with your team. Use version control best practices, including branches, pull requests, and code reviews. Apply Manifests: Use the kubectl apply command to apply your manifests to the Kubernetes cluster. This will create and manage the desired resources (pods, services, etc.) in the cluster. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD): Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or others. Automate the testing, building, and deployment of your application containers and manifests. Monitor and Scale: Use Kubernetes-native monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to monitor the health of your applications. Implement autoscaling for your application pods to handle increased traffic. Rollout Updates: Use Kubernetes controllers like Deployments to manage application updates and rollbacks gracefully. Apply new manifests with updated versions of your application containers. Backup and Disaster Recovery: Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies for persistent data and configurations. Regularly back up critical resources, such as Persistent Volumes and ConfigMaps. Security: Implement Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to manage access and permissions. Use network policies to control traffic between pods and secure your cluster. Documentation and Collaboration: Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for your Kubernetes resources and configurations. Collaborate with development and operations teams to ensure smooth application deployment and management.

It provides visibility into a system's behavior to more easily monitor and troubleshoot issues. - Monitoring involves collecting metrics and data on a system's performance and health. It allows detecting problems and setting alerts around critical events. Effective monitoring is key for identifying and diagnosing issues promptly. Logging --------- Logging refers to recording meaningful events within an application's code during execution. Logs provide insights into system operations, errors, and user activities. Log data is essential for monitoring and observability. Tracing --------- Tracing follows the path of a request through all the microservices, servers, and processes that handle parts of that request. Tracing distributed transactions helps pinpoint performance bottlenecks and failures. Metrics --------- Metrics represent measurements and counts of key activities and resources within a system. They allow assessing overall health and performance over time. Common metrics include response times, error rates, resource usage etc. Alerting --------- Alerting involves getting notifications when certain metrics cross defined thresholds. This allows rapid awareness of problems so corrective action can be taken. Alerts are triggered by monitoring systems based on log, metric, and tracing data. Logs vs Metrics vs Traces Metrics: -------- The purpose of metrics is to inform observers about the health & operations regarding a component or system. A metric represents a point in time measure of a particular source, and data-wise tends to be very small. The compact size allows for efficient collection even at scale in large systems. Metrics also lend themselves very well to pre-aggregation within the component before collection, reducing computation cost for processing & storing large numbers of metric time series in a central system. Due to how efficiently metrics are processed & stored, it lends itself very well for use in automated alerting, as metrics are an excellent source for the health data for all components in the system. Logs: ----- Log data inform observers about the discrete events that occurred within a component or a set of components. Just about every software component log information about its activities over time. This rich data tends to be much larger than metric data and can cause processing issues, especially if components are logging too verbosely. Therefore, using log data to understand the health of an extensive system tends to be avoided and depends on metrics for that data. Once metric telemetry highlights potential problem sources, filtered log data for those sources can be used to understand what occurred. Traces: ------- Where logging provides an overview to a discrete, event-triggered log, tracing encompasses a much wider, continuous view of an application. The goal of tracing is to following a program\u2019s flow and data progression. In many instances, tracing represents a single user\u2019s journey through an entire app stack. Its purpose isn\u2019t reactive, but instead focused on optimization. By tracing through a stack, developers can identify bottlenecks and focus on improving performance. A distributed trace is defined as a collection of spans. A span is the smallest unit in a trace and represents a piece of the workflow in a distributed landscape. It can be an HTTP request, call to a database, or execution of a message from a queue. When a problem does occur, tracing allows you to see how you got there: Which function. The function\u2019s duration. Parameters passed. How deep into the function the user could get. Logging Level A log level indicates the importance of a log message. It allows you to filter critical information from noise. Log levels originated in the 1980s with syslog for Unix. Syslog defined severity levels like -Emergency, -Alert, -Critical, -Error, -Warning, -Notice, -Informational, -Debug. These are now standard log levels used across many programming languages and logging frameworks. Log levels help reduce information overload and alarm fatigue. Looking at the severity level first tells you if a log requires immediate action. Proper use of log levels separates high priority alerts from routine diagnostic info.

It provides visibility into a system's behavior to more easily monitor and troubleshoot issues. - Monitoring involves collecting metrics and data on a system's performance and health. It allows detecting problems and setting alerts around critical events. Effective monitoring is key for identifying and diagnosing issues promptly. Logging --------- Logging refers to recording meaningful events within an application's code during execution. Logs provide insights into system operations, errors, and user activities. Log data is essential for monitoring and observability. Tracing --------- Tracing follows the path of a request through all the microservices, servers, and processes that handle parts of that request. Tracing distributed transactions helps pinpoint performance bottlenecks and failures. Metrics --------- Metrics represent measurements and counts of key activities and resources within a system. They allow assessing overall health and performance over time. Common metrics include response times, error rates, resource usage etc. Alerting --------- Alerting involves getting notifications when certain metrics cross defined thresholds. This allows rapid awareness of problems so corrective action can be taken. Alerts are triggered by monitoring systems based on log, metric, and tracing data.","title":"Observability &amp; Monitoring"},{"location":"more/observability/what-is-observability/#logs-vs-metrics-vs-traces","text":"Metrics: -------- The purpose of metrics is to inform observers about the health & operations regarding a component or system. A metric represents a point in time measure of a particular source, and data-wise tends to be very small. The compact size allows for efficient collection even at scale in large systems. Metrics also lend themselves very well to pre-aggregation within the component before collection, reducing computation cost for processing & storing large numbers of metric time series in a central system. Due to how efficiently metrics are processed & stored, it lends itself very well for use in automated alerting, as metrics are an excellent source for the health data for all components in the system. Logs: ----- Log data inform observers about the discrete events that occurred within a component or a set of components. Just about every software component log information about its activities over time. This rich data tends to be much larger than metric data and can cause processing issues, especially if components are logging too verbosely. Therefore, using log data to understand the health of an extensive system tends to be avoided and depends on metrics for that data. Once metric telemetry highlights potential problem sources, filtered log data for those sources can be used to understand what occurred. Traces: ------- Where logging provides an overview to a discrete, event-triggered log, tracing encompasses a much wider, continuous view of an application. The goal of tracing is to following a program\u2019s flow and data progression. In many instances, tracing represents a single user\u2019s journey through an entire app stack. Its purpose isn\u2019t reactive, but instead focused on optimization. By tracing through a stack, developers can identify bottlenecks and focus on improving performance. A distributed trace is defined as a collection of spans. A span is the smallest unit in a trace and represents a piece of the workflow in a distributed landscape. It can be an HTTP request, call to a database, or execution of a message from a queue. When a problem does occur, tracing allows you to see how you got there: Which function. The function\u2019s duration. Parameters passed. How deep into the function the user could get.","title":"Logs vs Metrics vs Traces"},{"location":"more/observability/what-is-observability/#logging-level","text":"A log level indicates the importance of a log message. It allows you to filter critical information from noise. Log levels originated in the 1980s with syslog for Unix. Syslog defined severity levels like -Emergency, -Alert, -Critical, -Error, -Warning, -Notice, -Informational, -Debug. These are now standard log levels used across many programming languages and logging frameworks. Log levels help reduce information overload and alarm fatigue. Looking at the severity level first tells you if a log requires immediate action. Proper use of log levels separates high priority alerts from routine diagnostic info. Modern frameworks allow logging data in formats like JSON. Logs can be sent to various destinations beyond syslog, like files or Elasticsearch.

Always use a unique API key for each team member on your account. An API key is a unique code that identifies your requests to the API. Your API key is intended to be used by you. The sharing of API keys is against the Terms of Use. As you begin experimenting, you may want to expand API access to your team. OpenAI does not support the sharing of API keys. Please invite new members to your account from the Members page and they will quickly receive their own unique key upon sign-in. You can assign permissions to individual API keys as well. Never deploy your key in client-side environments like browsers or mobile apps. Exposing your OpenAI API key in client-side environments like browsers or mobile apps allows malicious users to take that key and make requests on your behalf \u2013 which may lead to unexpected charges or compromise of certain account data. Requests should always be routed through your own backend server where you can keep your API key secure. Never commit your key to your repository Committing an API key to source code is a common vector for credential compromise. For those with public repositories, this is a common way that you can unknowingly share your key with the internet. Private repositories are more secure, but a data breach can also result in your keys being leaked. For these reasons we strongly recommend the use of the environment variables as a proactive key safety measure. Use Environment Variables in place of your API key An environment variable is a variable that is set on your operating system, rather than within your application. It consists of a name and value.We recommend that you set the name of the variable to OPENAI_API_KEY. By keeping this variable name consistent across your team, you can commit and share your code without the risk of exposing your API key. Linux / MacOS Set-up Option 1: Set your \u2018OPENAI_API_KEY\u2019 Environment Variable using zsh Run the following command in your terminal, replacing yourkey with your API key. echo \"export OPENAI_API_KEY='yourkey'\" >> ~/.zshrc Update the shell with the new variable: source ~/.zshrc Confirm that you have set your environment variable using the following command. echo $OPENAI_API_KEY The value of your API key will be the resulting output. Option 2: Set your \u2018OPENAI_API_KEY\u2019 Environment Variable using bash Follow the directions in Option 1, replacing .zshrc with .bash_profile. You\u2019re all set! You can now reference the key in curl or load it in your Python: import os import openai openai.api_key = os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] Use a Key Management Service There are a variety of products available for safely managing secret API keys. These tools allow you to control access to your keys and improve your overall data security. In the event of a data breach to your application, your key(s) would not be compromised, as they would be encrypted and managed in a completely separate location. For teams deploying their applications into production, we recommend you consider one of these services. Monitor your account usage and rotate your keys when needed A compromised API key allows a person to gain access to your account quota, without your consent. This can result in data loss, unexpected charges, a depletion of your monthly quota, and interruption in your API access. Your teams\u2019 Usage can be tracked via the Usage page. If you ever have concerns about misuse there are a few actions you can take to protect your account: Review your usage to see if it aligns with your team\u2019s work. For users belonging to multiple organizations (ex. corporate and personal), make sure the user has enabled tracking and set their default organization for usage and tracking. If you believe your key has been leaked, rotate your key immediately from the API Keys page. For customers with applications in production, you will need to update your key values accordingly.
