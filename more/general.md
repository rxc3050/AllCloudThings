-------------------------------------------------------------------	
Interview Prep:


1. **Familiarize Yourself with GCP Services**:
   - Learn about core GCP services like Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Functions, etc., as observability often involves monitoring applications and services running on these platforms.

2. **Master GCP Observability Services**:
   - **Stackdriver**: This is GCP's native observability suite which includes Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing.
      - Understand how to set up and use Stackdriver Monitoring for metric collection.
      - Learn about Stackdriver Logging for centralized log management.
      - Explore Stackdriver Trace for distributed tracing.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Understand the concepts of:
      - Metrics, time series data, and alerting policies.
      - Creating custom metrics.
      - Setting up alerting policies to monitor critical resources.

4. **Logging**:
   - Learn how to:
      - Set up logs ingestion from various sources.
      - Create log-based metrics and alerts.
      - Use advanced querying and filtering in Stackdriver Logs.

5. **Tracing**:
   - Familiarize yourself with:
      - Distributed tracing concepts and how it helps in understanding application performance.
      - Using Stackdriver Trace for monitoring request flow across services.

6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - Learn tools like Terraform to define and provision infrastructure on GCP. This will help in automating the setup of observability resources.

7. **Container Orchestration**:
   - Understand how to monitor services running on Kubernetes, including pod health, resource utilization, and application-level metrics.

8. **Understanding Metrics and Alerts**:
   - Learn about different types of metrics (counter, gauge, histogram) and how to set up effective alerting strategies.

9. **Scripting and Automation**:
   - Python, Bash, or any scripting language of your choice can be useful for automating tasks, processing logs, and interacting with GCP APIs.

10. **Security and Compliance**:
    - Understand security best practices and compliance standards relevant to observability.

11. **Practice with Real-world Scenarios**:
    - Set up a sample application on GCP and practice monitoring, logging, and tracing it. Create alerts and analyze logs and traces.

12. **Certifications**:
    - Consider pursuing GCP certifications like the Professional Cloud Network Engineer or Professional Data Engineer. While not specific to observability, they cover important concepts.

13. **Stay Updated**:
    - Follow GCP announcements and updates, as new features and services might be relevant to your role.

14. **Networking and Troubleshooting**:
    - Develop a good understanding of networking concepts and troubleshooting skills as they are crucial for effective observability.
